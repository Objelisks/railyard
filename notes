regl for three d rendering
choo because trains and also for ui
peerjs for networking

something for tiles
something for animation??
something for game state?

milestones

index.html
script.js
serve libraries
set up camera params
render a box
render a train
i think i need browserify, BUT just for libraries
initial network connections
sync positions
simple input
simple ui
move a train from x to y
sync movement
render a track
pull request esm modules for peerjs and choo https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module


sqrt(2)*side/4 for 90 degree curve?
snap endpoints based on closest other endpoints
track options: straight, 45, 90, S, switch, quad bezier
drag a line and bend it
revisit whether i wanna keep doing quadratic or use cubic to make it easier to match angles



architecture:
canvas which draws the trains
overlay using choo, which:
    names the room for people to join (use signalhub app name)
    create new train?
    create new track module

progressive state thing
dialog box, dropshadow
    text box for room name -> validate text
    ok button -> toggle based on text

in game
    train speed knob
        project mouse pos along tangent of first click to spin knob
    leave room button
    reset train button

models:
single color via vertex colors
start off with everything being a colored box
uvs on palette texture
engine, several cars, tracks, trees, rocks, water, station, station equipment, signals, terrain
animation? probably not

ambient occlusion and hella tilt shift



networking:
first player starts a room by putting in a name
everyone else connects to that name



gameplay:

start off with a loop, each player can connect their railyard to the loop
stations that will load cars with resource
stations that will unload cars of resource
train whistle

hook it up to midi input so we can use knobs!!!
