PHYSICS

matter-js
all i need is distance joints for spring simulation
turn off gravity

update:
    apply external forces
        apply friction
        apply motor
        apply rail correction perpendicular to rail times distance
    step world
    sync render to physics
        set bogie rotation - train render defined by bogies
        set bogie position

on train create:
    local/network
        make bogie 1
        make bogie 2
        make constraint between bogies

on train remove:
    find bodies and remove them and all constraints attached to them

on connection
    make constraint between bogies

object picker!
    visual icons of objects to place in the world
    make it 3d why not
    soon as i make it 3d tho, its probably not choo anymore?


ground tiles:
    heightmap displaced highres plane
    rails through tile replace material on tile with rail material


todo:
    ~ fix spring forces
    sync turnouts?
    what to do about cars that go off track, fully or partially ->> mario lakitu mode on em
    figure out a clever way to hide z-fighting
    ~ rubberband state on update
    non-connection collision
    touch-position package for supporting touch events
    gif generator?



ON MIPMAPS
    the prefiltered map needs extra mipmap levels generated
    regl/webgl1 doesn't support incomplete mipmaps and cmft exports them incomplete by default
    TODO: detect number of mipmaps by images.length / 6

skybox workflow:
    find high res hdr environment map
    open in cmft
        tonemap skybox, output as rgba32f cubemap dds
        generate radiance, output same
        generate irradiance, output same
    open _pmrem in PVRTexTool
        generate mipmaps
        save as rgba32f
    copy all to materials folder



libraries to look into
    touch-position
    gl-gif
    gl-render-cubemap
    gl-sprite-text

make use of vectors more efficient
? selecting trains
? move a train from x to yz
render a geometry track

reorder tracks in turnout based on arbitrary line intersection through curves
build a module
saving / exporting modules
loading modules

track options: straight, 45, 90, S, switch, cubic bezier

static modules??

unpowered train cars
connect/disconnect (shouldn't be able to connect to another full train, maybe?)
mass considerations?
loading/unload resources
buildings

signals?
stations
track ends


The Networking Integration
    voting:
        array of voting members, set to current users (ignore anyone who joins during the voting process)
        try for consensus until max attempts, and then take the value with most votes, and then local value
    welcome to room
    vote on placement
    place neutral track
    X sync train positions, rotations, speed
    X sync tracks


button to toggle train collision
events:
    switch train controlled
    vote request: type
    vote response: accept, revision
    vote result: type, data

data compression (make ids smaller) (do this last or only if an issue comes up)
    train: pos, rot, speed, id
    turnout init: list of track ids, open
    turnout state: list of bool
    track: id, 4 points

don't need yet probably:
    sync turnout state harder
    blend avg of player updates but rewind and extrapolate, window of 10 updates (60 frames)
    sync networking on regl tick


Create Your Own Train Line
    customize train color
    logo procedurally generated from random shapes
    four letters: JNCO line
        i definitely need to make up a bunch of fake train companies / generate them


The Train Car Conjuction
    train to train collision
    X raycast boxes
    spawn cars
    X connect / disconnect cars
    stations


The Modular Track Invention
    skyboard
    standards: minimum two through tracks
    create a layout
        carcassone tiles


The Shader Construction
    make some models, maybe??
    get tracks rendering as actual tracks with ties
    make some pbr materials, learn to paint them


SOUND EFFECTS????
    tunnel echo
    train whistle button
    background music


gameplay:
    choose a room name
    you're given a bunch of random track module tiles
    place the tiles to create a layout
    random exits from your layout are joined to the common layout (random roundabout)
    speed control
        speed when not actively controlled?
        interaction with collision
    switch control
        N just a direction indicator that automatically flips switches in front of your train (can have turnouts with 8 tracks output??)
        click on switches to toggle them
    train control
        multiple trains?
        control transfer btwn players?
    camera control
        kite
        conductor
        bird
        tower

in game
    train speed knob
        project mouse pos along tangent of first click to spin knob
    leave room button
    reset train button
what if the first part of joining a room is playing carcassone
shader noise fade in
dynamic lines using preallocated buffer
make trains tilt when they turn


models:
start off with everything being a colored box
uvs on palette texture
engine, several cars, tracks, trees, rocks, water, station, station equipment, signals, terrain
animation? probably not

ambient occlusion and hella tilt shift



networking:
first player starts a room by putting in a name
everyone else connects to that name



gameplay:

start off with a loop, each player can connect their railyard to the loop
stations that will load cars with resource
stations that will unload cars of resource
train whistle


bonus:

hook it up to midi input so we can use knobs!!!
