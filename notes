regl for three d rendering
choo because trains and also for ui
peerjs for networking

something for tiles
something for animation??
something for game state?

milestones

sync tracks
sync positions
sync movement
? selecting trains
? move a train from x to yz
render a geometry track
pull request esm modules for peerjs and choo https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module

reorder tracks in turnout based on arbitrary line intersection through curves
build a module
saving / exporting modules
loading modules

track options: straight, 45, 90, S, switch, cubic bezier

sync networking on regl tick
blend avg of player updates but rewind and extrapolate, window of 10 updates (60 frames)
static modules??

unpowered train cars
connect/disconnect (shouldn't be able to connect to another full train, maybe?)
mass considerations?
loading/unload resources
buildings

signals?
stations
track ends


The Networking Integration


The Train Car Conjuction


The Modular Track Invention
    skyboard
    standards: minimum two through tracks


gameplay:
    choose a room name
    you're given a bunch of random track module tiles
    place the tiles to create a layout
    random exits from your layout are joined to the common layout (random roundabout)
    speed control
        speed when not actively controlled?
        interaction with collision
    switch control
        X just a direction indicator that automatically flips switches in front of your train (can have turnouts with 8 tracks output??)
        click on switches to toggle them
    train control
        multiple trains?
        control transfer btwn players?
    camera control
        kite
        conductor
        bird
        tower


architecture:
canvas which draws the trains
overlay using choo, which:
    names the room for people to join (use signalhub app name)
    create new train?
    create new track module

progressive state thing
dialog box, dropshadow
    text box for room name -> validate text
    ok button -> toggle based on text

in game
    train speed knob
        project mouse pos along tangent of first click to spin knob
    leave room button
    reset train button
what if the first part of joining a room is playing carcassone
shader noise fade in
dynamic lines using preallocated buffer
make trains tilt when they turn


models:
single color via vertex colors
start off with everything being a colored box
uvs on palette texture
engine, several cars, tracks, trees, rocks, water, station, station equipment, signals, terrain
animation? probably not

ambient occlusion and hella tilt shift



networking:
first player starts a room by putting in a name
everyone else connects to that name



gameplay:

start off with a loop, each player can connect their railyard to the loop
stations that will load cars with resource
stations that will unload cars of resource
train whistle

hook it up to midi input so we can use knobs!!!

done:

X index.html
X script.js
X serve libraries
X set up camera params
X render a box
X render a train
X i think i need browserify, BUT just for libraries
X initial network connections
X simple input
X simple ui
X connect tracks
X figure out switches (disable a segment in a direction?) 
X pbr shader
X fix choo routing issue
X clicking ground
X drawing tracks dynamically
X camera controls
X snap to track endpoints
X use endpoint tangents
X creating switches
X move debug stuff to separate file
X switch to cubic bezier
X fix switches
X fix moveBogie
X refactoring pass
X throttled log
X render canvas from choo to use state
